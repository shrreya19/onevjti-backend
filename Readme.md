Please follow the guidelines below to ensure smooth collaboration and avoid conflicts.

## Team Workflow Rules

### ❌ Do NOT push directly to `main`
- `main` must always stay stable
- All work should be done on **feature branches**

### ✅ Always work on a branch
Each contributor creates their own branch for features or fixes.

## How to setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mediahub-backend.git
cd onevjti-backend
npm install
